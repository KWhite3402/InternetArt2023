        &nbsp; 
    <p> The weak breeze whispers nothing <br>
        the water screams sublime. <br>
        His feet shift, teeter-totter <br>
        deep breaths, stand back, it’s time. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> Toes untouch the overpass <br>
        soon he’s water-bound. <br>
        Eyes locked shut but peek to see <br>
        the view from halfway down. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p>  A little wind, a summer sun<br>
        a river rich and regal. <br>
        A flood of fond endorphins <br>
        brings a calm that knows no equal. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> You’re flying now, you see things <br>
        much more clear than from the ground. <br>
        It's all okay, or it would be <br>
        were you not now halfway down. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> Thrash to break from gravity <br>
        what now could slow the drop? <br>
        All I’d give for toes to touch <br>
        the safety back at top.<p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> But this is it, the deed is done <br>
        silence drowns the sound. <br>
        Before I leaped I should've seen <br>
        the view from halfway down. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> I really should’ve thought about <br>
        the view from halfway down. <br>
        I wish I could've known about <br>
        the view from halfway down— </p>
