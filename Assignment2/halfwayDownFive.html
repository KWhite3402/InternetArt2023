        &nbsp; 
    <p> The weak breeze whispers nothing <br>
        the <span class="water">water</span> screams sublime. <br>
        His feet shift, teeter-totter <br>
        deep breaths, stand back, it’s time. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> Toes untouch the overpass <br>
        soon he’s <span class= "water"> water-bound.</span> <br>
        Eyes locked shut but peek to see <br>
        the view from halfway down. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p>  A little wind, a summer sun<br>
        a <span class="water">river</span> rich and regal. <br>
        A flood of fond endorphins <br>
        brings a calm that knows no equal. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> You’re <span class="flying">flying</span> now, you see things <br>
        much more clear than from the ground. <br>
        It's all okay, or it would be <br>
        were you not now halfway down. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> Thrash to break from gravity <br>
        what now could slow the drop? <br>
        All I’d give for toes to touch <br>
        the safety back at top.<p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> But this is it, the deed is done <br>
        <span class="silence">silence drowns the sound.</span> <br>
        Before I leaped I should've seen <br>
        the view from halfway down. <p>
        &nbsp;
    <p> I really should’ve thought about <br>
        the view from halfway down. <br>
        I wish I could've known about <br>
        the view from halfway <span class="down">down—</span> </p>
