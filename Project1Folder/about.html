    <p>My work primarily centers around the themes of Afro-fantasy and activism, mainly in genres where Black figures have been historically underrepresented or mischaracterized. I believe that stories of the Black experience don’t need to be limited to stories of struggle or subjugation, but instead can explore the more fantastical elements of fiction and allow more variety to exist within the breadth of Black storytelling. 
        My work is meant to invoke the feelings of traditionally Tolkien-type fantasy: large, expansive worlds of lore and development that holds a variety of characters and stories to tell. I primarily work with digital mediums; animation, digital illustration, and game design in order to tell these stories. I think that interactive mediums are an opportunity to experiment with the idea of the stories and experiences of characters being put into the hands of the viewer. It’s one thing to view a work of art, but another thing entirely to play a part in its creation. That’s why I think that my use of interactive mediums is so effective in bolstering my body of work and supporting my concept.
        People have always told stories, arming ourselves with fantasy and engrossing ourselves in the lives of characters so that our own lives are a little more manageable. While I don’t expect my work to be revolutionary, I do want to provide my community with stories and experiences that put them as the hero of the story, so Black children and adults alike can see a bit more of themselves in the media that they grow up with and continue to consume.
