        <li>Weekly A</li>
        <div>This week was a lot busier than I thought it would be. I learned a lot in
            class, and had plenty of opportunities to play around with html. I
            actually got a couple of pages set up and have been messing around with
            the different functions and things like that, so I feel like Ive gotten a
            lot of good practice in. I’m excited for the first project, although I
            kinda wish that I could play around with CSS in order to add some variety
            to the pages, but I’ve had a pretty good time with just the html script
            that I don’t really mind too much.
            I’m excited to pair up what I’ll learn in this class with the things from
            the things from my other classes; I think it’ll be really interesting to
            see what I can come up with. I enjoy coding, so I think it’ll be nice to
            continue learning new coding languages and being able to apply them to my
            own works and experiences.</div>

        <div>For this week, I had a really nice time learning CSS. I feel like I've been getting a hang of html pretty well, and I've been having fun messing around with the code. Fiddling with the different properties has been really eye-opening; I'm enjoying being able to customize my html pages, and use the style pages in order to add more design to the things that I write. It was interesting being able to experiment with fonts, colors, and layouts. Being able to see the changes being made via the live server on Visual Studio Code is also really helpful, it makes it a lot easier to go back and forth between coding and seeing those changes reflected back on the webpage in real time.
            I've also been really trying to keep my code clean and maintain my formatting, even if it isn't entirely necessary to the computer being able to read the code. I just find that it's personally easier to backtrack and find out my train of thought when I make an effort to properly format my code, and leave plenty of comments so I can remind myself of the things that I did prior, just in case I want to revisit those techniques. I also find that cleaning my code makes it a lot more maintainable; it's easier to spend a couple of minutes putting pages into folders and organizing them so that I can easily find them later, instead of spending forever pouring over different pages of code, looking for one specific thing within a mess of code, style, and images.</div>

        <div>This week mostly focused on working with JavaScript, which I’m prety excited for since a good
            bit of my website is going to rely on interactivity, and I know that working with JS is really going
            to provide the edge that I need. I’ve already got a litle bit of experience on my own working
            with the language, so I don’t expect things to be too hard to pick up on, but I’m interested to
            see where I’m going to be able to go with the language and find out how I’m going to be able to
            implement it into my website.
            In other news, this weekend I was at the Ohio Retro Gaming convention for my internship,
            which was a prety fun endeavor. I’ve been working on the project since February of this year,
            and this is the first convention that I’ve gone to from a business perspective, so it was really
            exciting to be able to showcase the game that I’ve been able to spend months working on. Since
            the entire company is prety much remote, this was the first time that I met a lot of people in
            person, which was prety awesome since I’d only ever interacted with them in our company
            Discord server. We went to dinner at the end of the convention, and it was a lot of fun being
            able to interact with them outside of just business. I’m excited for the next step of the game
            (and to move from being an intern to being a full-on member), and I’m looking forward to
            working on releasing the demo in February.</div>
